package transport

// The count test the task names: three or more callers racing a sealed
// vault produce exactly ONE vault.unlockRequest, and one answer resolves
// all of them — asserted over the real socket path the existing transport
// tests use (real vault, real WSServer, real WebSocket). The defect is in
// the path, not in a function, so the proof is too: the vault
// (internal/vault/unlock.go) holds the "one unlock pending" state, raises
// one prompt through the transport's RequestUnlock, and every caller that
// arrives while it is outstanding joins it.
//
// The count is deterministic by construction. While the first ask is
// pending, no second ask can exist — the vault's pending gate is the whole
// point of the seam. The resolution is sent only after the vault has been
// unsealed for real (the renderer's actual flow: the user unlocks, then the
// resolution is answered), so a caller that arrives late observes
// StateUnsealed and returns without raising anything. Exactly one ask can
// therefore exist in the whole test, and one answer must release all three
// callers. An implementation that raised one ask per caller would broadcast
// extra frames and leave the extra callers blocked on asks nobody answers —
// the negative frame check and the receive below would both catch it.
