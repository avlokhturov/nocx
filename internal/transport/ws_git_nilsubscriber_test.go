// shut after its socket dropped. rx.getSubscriber() then hands back a nil
// *wsConn, and the notify path must simply do nothing.
//
// The outbound migration briefly broke this in a way no ordinary reading
// catches: the parameter became the Responder interface, and a nil *wsConn
// stored in an interface is not equal to nil. The `wconn == nil` guard went
// on looking correct while passing, and TryNotify dereferenced a nil
// receiver on a goroutine — a panic that takes the whole backend down, and
// one that only fires when a subscriber happens to be absent, so a green
// suite is no evidence against it.

// an explicit close both run — the handler calls closeSession while the
// registry close wakes monitorExit. Deleting a git binding is also the only
// chance to announce it, to the subscriber the claimant captured off the
// receiver it removed, so the owner that did NOT claim must leave the
// bindings alone rather than delete the announcement out from under the one
// that did.
//
// Here monitorExit's claim is simulated by taking the receiver first, which
// is exactly what it does. Against the unclaimed teardown this test fails:
// closeSession deletes the binding with nobody to send it to, and the
// git.changed(reason=sessionClosed) the claimant was about to enqueue never
// exists (nocx-2h08 — reproduced live by delaying monitorExit between its
// removeRx and its gitSessionClosed).
