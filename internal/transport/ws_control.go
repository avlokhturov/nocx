package transport

// The bounded off-loop executor for control work that must not freeze the
// read loop: connections.test probes and dialog.openFile.
//
// Both run on their own goroutine under a capacity-one admission (the
// internal/transport/control seam, nocx-sfv6.3): the read loop submits and
// moves on, the Submission decides whether the work runs now or is refused,
// and the permit is released when the task returns — cancelled or not. A
// task's context derives from the connection context, so a disconnect
// cancels the work, and the same derived context lets Stop cancel every
// in-flight task at shutdown.
