// TestResponseEnqueuedBeforeReleaseIsNotRefused drives the defect window
// DIRECTLY, deterministically: the handler enqueues its response inside the
// task, and the permit is released a moment later — so a sequential client
// that answers the response and sends its next conflicting request can land
// in that window. The test holds the window open: the first task signals
// that its response is on the wire and then blocks, still holding the
// conflict gate (exactly the task tail of the real wiring). The second
// submission must WAIT, never be refused.
//
// The wiring under test mirrors the transport's: the submission is a queue
// (bounded spawner) and the TASK acquires the operation's composite —
// conflict gates (waiting) before the lane — inside its Run, on the task
// goroutine. Against the old non-blocking gates this test fails
// deterministically: the second task's composite acquire refuses instantly.
