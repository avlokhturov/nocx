// Package procwatch observes the lifecycle of processes THIS backend
// started: it answers "is the executable I launched still the one running
// under that pid, and if not, what is?".
//
// It exists because the product had exactly one detector for a shell that
// will never integrate — the handshake bound expiring ten seconds later
// (nocx-cgzc). The shell that gets taken over is our own child, and it
// becomes somebody else's image within milliseconds: a user's ~/.zshrc that
// execs a pty wrapper before nocx's own line runs leaves a tab that looks
// integrated for ten seconds and then is not.
//
// # This is not stream sniffing
//
// AD-6 forbids the backend to interpret the BYTES a session produces. This
// package never reads them. It asks the kernel about the process table entry
// of a pid the backend itself forked, which is the same class of knowledge as
// "the shell exited" (exec.Cmd.Wait) and carries none of the terminal's
// content. ADR-0024 separately rules out TIOCGPGRP as an authority on "who
// wrote these bytes"; nothing here claims that authority either — an
// observation is a GUESS, the contract says so
// (contracts/session.integrationChanged.schema.json: detail is "best-effort
// observation for the details surface, never authority"), and the product
// labels it as one. The domain is still established only by the
// authenticated hello.
//
// # By name only
//
// An Observation carries a bare executable name — no path, no arguments, no
// command line. That is what the schema permits, and the reason is not
// brevity: a command line carries the user's own text into a surface that is
// not theirs. On darwin the source is the kernel's own p_comm, which is
// derived from the image's basename and truncated to 16 characters, so the
// restriction is enforced by where the value comes from and not only by a
// filter here. Note what this is NOT: KERN_PROCARGS2, whose environment half
// macOS has refused to answer for any other pid since 10.15 (that read was
// removed in nocx-58gq/nocx-65v6). p_comm is a different sysctl and is public
// — it is what `ps` prints.
//
// # One platform observes, the rest say so
//
// The platform half sits behind one build-tagged constructor, the house
// pattern (internal/contentkey, internal/nativeports):
//
//   - darwin: kqueue EVFILT_PROC with NOTE_EXEC. The kernel tells us the
//     moment our own child replaces its image, which is the whole point —
//     the answer arrives in milliseconds and does not depend on us asking at
//     the right moment.
//   - everywhere else: ErrUnsupported, deliberately. Linux has no NOTE_EXEC.
//     The three alternatives were considered and none is worth having:
//     polling /proc/<pid>/exe is a race by construction (a wrapper that execs
//     and exits between two polls is invisible, and a poll interval is the
//     timing dependence AGENTS.md forbids); the netlink proc connector needs
//     a privilege a terminal has no business asking for; and ptrace changes
//     the child's behaviour to observe it. An honest "this platform does not
//     observe exec" leaves the handshake bound as the detector it already is,
//     which is a slower correct answer rather than a fast wrong one. The MVP
//     desktop shell is macOS (AD-3), and this is the platform the defect was
//     measured on.
//
// # A measurement worth keeping
//
// macOS's /bin/sh replaces its own image with bash about twenty milliseconds
// after it starts — p_comm goes "sh" then "bash". It is a real, benign
// self-replacement and it is why nothing here is tested with sh. It reaches
// no session: LocalShellKind maps sh to ShellUnknown, and an unknown shell is
// reported conventional and never watched. zsh and bash, the two shells nocx
// does start an integrated session with, hold their name for the life of the
// process, and their p_comm is the basename of the path that was exec'd.

// Sink receives an observation. It is called at most once per watch, on the
