// The unresolved-redaction spans of a recalled command (ADR-0021's
// consequence, made structural this round): a history row that was masked
// cannot run as written — the value is not in the text. When recall places
// such a row in the editor, its redaction segments are registered here as a
// StateField of spans; the editor renders each as the unresolved chip
// variant, the host refuses to submit while any remain, and Enter opens
// resolution on the first one. Picking a secret replaces the span with
// {{secret:NAME}}, which renders as the ordinary resolved chip; the span
// collapses to zero length and leaves the list.
//
// The spans are positions, mapped through every subsequent edit — a
// one-shot decoration set would point at the wrong text the moment the user
// types. The host replaces the whole set when recall places a different
// row, or with [] when the draft is restored.
