/**
 * The name-and-colour dialog: one form, and every subject in the strip that
 * has both asks through it (nocx-2mipw, then the tab).
 *
 * IT REPLACED `showPrompt`, and the replacement is the point. A workspace was
 * created by a one-line text prompt, which is the kit's shape for "ask the
 * user for one thing" — and a workspace is not one thing. As soon as it has a
 * colour it needs a form, and building it as a form now is what makes the
 * field after this one an addition rather than a second rewrite.
 *
 * A TAB ASKS THE SAME QUESTION AND USED TO ASK IT TWICE OVER: a text prompt
 * for the name, and a run of colour words in the context menu for the colour
 * — "Green", "Amber", "Red", "Violet", one row each, with the palette buried
 * among Rename, Pin and Close. Two surfaces for one decision, and neither
 * showed the colour it was offering. One form, both subjects, and the menu
 * goes back to being a menu of actions.
 *
 * ONE PALETTE, TOO. The tab used to carry four THEME accents on the argument
 * that a decorated tab must still read after a theme change; the workspace
 * carries nine fixed hues because a container's identity may not shift under
 * it. Offering a person two palettes for the same act — "colour this thing in
 * the strip" — is a distinction they never asked for and cannot see the
 * reason for. The workspace's is the one that survives, because identity is
 * what a colour on a tab is for as well; the hues are declared identically in
 * every theme file (ADR-0013), so nothing loses its colour when the theme
 * changes.
 *
 * THE NAME IS PRE-FILLED, WHICH AMENDS §4.1 of the workspaces UX design. That
 * section says the name "is asked for and never invented" — a workspace,
 * unlike a tab, is always created deliberately, so it always has a name the
 * person typed. The owner chose Edge's behaviour instead, on sight: the field
 * opens with `Workspace N` selected, so Enter accepts it and the first
 * keystroke replaces it. The distinction §4.1 was protecting survives — the
 * name is still visible, still editable, and still refused when blank — but
 * "typed by a person" becomes "accepted by a person".
 *
 * THE COLOUR OFFERED FOR A NEW WORKSPACE IS THE LEAST-USED ONE
 * (layout/workspace-colours.ts), not a hash of the id and not the first
 * swatch. A default that collides on the second workspace is not a
 * suggestion, it is a chore.
