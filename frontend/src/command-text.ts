// One way to put a command on screen, for every surface that shows one.
//
// A command carrying `{{secret:NAME}}` reads as a chip in the editor, and it
// took three separate rounds of "why is it raw here too?" to notice that the
// question was never about any one surface: the editor, the scrollback block
// and the recall panel each rendered command text their own way, so each one
// had to learn about references separately, and each one learned late. This
// module is the answer to "can it be done globally" — a surface calls it
// instead of building text nodes, and a future kind of decoration is added
// here once rather than in every window that displays a command.
//
// The editor is the deliberate exception and stays a CodeMirror decoration:
// its text is editable and its ranges must map through every keystroke,
// which is a different mechanism for the same fact (see secret-chip.ts).
