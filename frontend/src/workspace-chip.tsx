/**
 * WorkspaceChip — a workspace as a SEGMENT OF THE TAB ROW, not as a mode of
 * the window (workspaces UX rework; amends design §4.3).
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY. §4.3 gave the horizontal strip one chip on the
 * left: the row drew the current workspace's tabs, and every other workspace
 * was reachable only by opening the chip's menu. Two complaints in first use,
 * and they are the same complaint: switching is a dropdown, and the tabs you
 * are not looking at are gone from the screen entirely. §4.3 had rejected
 * inline chips — the Firefox/Chrome/Edge shape — on the grounds that "lineage
 * depth does not fit in one row". That reason does not hold: the horizontal
 * strip never draws lineage at all, because the same section puts the tree in
 * the vertical strip and keeps this row flat. The rejection was answering a
 * problem this row does not have.
 *
 * SO A WORKSPACE IS NOW A RUN OF TABS WITH A PILL IN FRONT OF IT. Every
 * workspace is present in the row at all times. The one holding the current
 * tab shows its tabs; the rest are folded to their pill. Switching stops
 * being a mode change performed through a menu and becomes what it always
 * was on this row — clicking a tab, or clicking the pill that stands for a
 * run of them.
 *
 * THE PILL REPORTS, IT DOES NOT MERELY LABEL (`layout/workspace-colour.ts`).
 * A folded browser tab group is inert; a folded workspace here can hold three
 * agents, one of which is waiting on a human. The attention mark is what makes
 * folding safe, and it is the reason this design can hide anything at all.
 *
 * IT STILL ADVERTISES NAVIGATION AND NOTHING ELSE (§5.5). Membership, not a
 * fence: no shield, no lock, no "isolated". The colour is identity — the one
 * thing you read sideways — and never a status the workspace does not have.
 *
 * It PLACES a kit component and repaints none: the control is the kit's
 * workspace Button, which owns the full-height coloured badge and type. This
 * file positions it and carries the three `data-*` facts (colour, expanded,
 * attention) its contents read.

            column of rows in a rail. Here it made the workspace the smallest
