// What is LIVE in a set of tabs, and the sentence that names it
// (nocx-isoph.6; §4.1 and §4.4 of the workspaces UX design, rule D6).
//
// Closing a workspace closes all of its tabs, so the person is owed the one
// thing a count cannot give them: WHICH of those tabs is doing something.
// "Close 4 tabs?" is a number nobody can weigh; that one of the four is a
// running deploy and another is an ssh session into production is a fact they
// can act on. This module owns that naming and nothing else — it decides
// nothing, exactly like lineage.ts, because the whole point of the surface it
// feeds is to ASK rather than to decide.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT lineage.ts. That module answers a question about an EDGE —
// which live tabs descend from this one — and its sentence says that closing
// a parent LEAVES them running. This one answers a question about a
// CONTAINER, and its sentence says the opposite: these go with it. Two
// questions, two answers; what they genuinely share is how many things a
// prompt may name before the list stops being readable, and that lives here
// once as `nameAtMost`, which lineage.ts imports.
//
// WHY A LOCAL SHELL AT A PROMPT IS NOT LIVE. Nothing is lost by closing it —
// a new one costs a keystroke. A running command is work in flight, and a
// session on another machine is a connection whose state (an agent, a jump
// host, a sudo timestamp, an interactive program's screen) is not free to
// recreate, whether or not a command is running in it at this instant. Those
// two are what a person needs named before they answer.
