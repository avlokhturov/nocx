/**
 * The exit JSON-RPC notification: the backend telling the renderer that a session ended (nocx-ictcq). Server-initiated and unsolicited, so it has no request to correlate against and no caller checking its shape — which is exactly where an addressing or shape defect would hide, and why it gets the same three checks as a method. The cause is the discriminator: an authoritative terminal event — the shell itself exited, carrying its exit status — versus a loss — the channel is gone, the host is unreachable, a handshake expired, a reattach failed, or the session was torn down without an authoritative status. The two are deliberately indistinguishable at the wire today's payload, which is why a tab whose ssh connection dropped silently vanished. A lost tab must be marked, never destroyed; a clean exit closes it exactly as before. The renderer routes the notification by sessionId (AD-7); the cause is a closed set (oneOf, const branches) so a shape that cannot exist cannot be sent. status is present exactly when cause is "exited" and is the shell's own exit status — a loss never carries one.

The granular detail is deliberately NOT on this wire: internal/lifecyclechannel.LossCause (hello-timeout, end-of-stream, read-error, closed) names losses of the authenticated lifecycle channel and is that vocabulary's single owner (nocx-viil.1), while this notification fires for every session — plain non-integrated ssh and local shells included — where no lifecycle channel may ever have existed. The axis that knows the detail (session.integrationChanged, carrying ssh.RefusalReason) already says it for the sessions that have one; this discriminator's job is mark-vs-close.
