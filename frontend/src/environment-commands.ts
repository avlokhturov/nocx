 *
 * The recognised set is conservative by design: a missed offer is invisible
 * and cheap; a wrong one is noise on every `sleep 5`. The default for an
 * unknown command is `false` — not an environment change.
 *
 * **Grows by addition.** When a new environment-entry command is needed,
 * add it here and to the test table in environment-commands.test.ts.
 *
 * The `ssh` arm delegates to ssh-transition.ts: ONE parser for "did the user
 * go somewhere and expect a shell", because two would drift.
