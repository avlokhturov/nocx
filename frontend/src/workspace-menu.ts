// workspaceActionRows — what you can DO to a workspace, in one place
// (nocx-isoph.7; workspaces UX design §4.3).
//
// ONE MECHANISM, PLACED TWICE, and that is the whole reason this is a module
// rather than two lists. A window shows one workspace at a time behind a chip
// (§4.3), and a vertical strip shows every workspace at once under headings
// (§4.2) — two views of ONE set. The actions are the same in both, so they are
// built here and placed by whoever is drawing: the chip's switcher appends
// them to its navigation rows, and a vertical group heading opens them for the
// workspace it heads. Building them twice is how the two would come to differ,
// and they would differ first in the rule below, which is the one that matters.
//
// THE DEFAULT WORKSPACE OFFERS NOTHING, and that is a property here rather
// than a branch in each caller. It has no name to change (§4.2 — its stored
// name is never read, see layout/strip-groups.ts), it is permanent, so there
// is nothing to close, and it is not a member of the arrangement a user made,
// so there is nothing to move. The affordances DO NOT EXIST for it rather than
// existing and refusing: an enabled row that answers "no" is a promise the
// product cannot keep, and a disabled one is the same promise greyed out.
//
// NAVIGATION IS NOT HERE. Switching workspaces is the chip's own reason to
// exist and the vertical strip answers it by showing every group at once, so a
// switch row built here would be an action for one placement wearing the shape
// of a shared one.
