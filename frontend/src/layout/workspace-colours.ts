// The colours a workspace can be given (nocx-2mipw; workspaces UX design §3,
// which has said `id, name, colour` since the first draft).
//
// THE PALETTE FOR EVERYTHING A PERSON COLOURS IN THE STRIP — a workspace, and
// since 2026-08-18 a tab as well.
//
// It began as a second palette beside `tab-colours.ts`, which offered four
// THEME accents on the argument that a tab decorated under one theme must
// still read under another. A workspace's colour is the opposite requirement:
// it is the identity of a container the user made, so it must NOT shift when
// the theme does, any more than its name would. That reasoning was sound
// about workspaces and wrong about the difference: identity is what a colour
// on a TAB is for too, and offering two palettes for one act — "colour this
// thing in the strip" — was a distinction visible only from inside the code.
// One set now, and `tab-colours.ts` is gone.
//
// The hues are declared IDENTICALLY in every theme file (styles/themes/*.css,
// the `--ws-*` block), which is what makes "does not vary with the theme" true
// while leaving each theme free to override one its ground cannot show — the
// arrangement ADR-0013 asks for, rather than a single shared file the
// integrity gate would reject.
//
// NINE, AND NOT FIFTEEN, which is what Edge offers. Past roughly nine hues an
// 8px dot stops being tellable apart, and a colour the user can choose but
// cannot then read back is worse than one fewer choice.

 *
 * WHY LEAST-USED AND NOT A HASH OF THE ID. The first version derived a colour
 * by hashing the id, which is stable and requires no state — and gives a
 * collision on the second workspace as readily as on the ninth, at random. A
 * default that collides on a fresh install is a default nobody keeps, and
 * then the picker is not offering a suggestion, it is offering a chore.
 *
 * IT DEGRADES INSTEAD OF FAILING. Past nine workspaces every colour is taken,
 * so this begins handing out seconds — evenly, because it counts. Collisions
 * are allowed: a colour is a recognition aid and never the identifier, which
 * is the name and the position. A tenth workspace refused for want of a
 * colour would be absurd; a tenth workspace sharing blue with the second is
 * merely ordinary, and Chrome and Edge have always worked that way.
 *
 * `taken` may contain nulls and values this renderer does not know — the
 * default workspace's absence and a newer renderer's colour both land here —
 * and both are simply not counted, which is the honest reading: neither is a
 * palette entry this picker can offer.
